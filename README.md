#Abstract
Sentiment analysis is among the primary natural language processing (NLP)
 tasks and is widely utilized for extracting emotions and sentiments from text
 corpora. This paper proposes a comprehensive sentiment analysis approach for
 movie reviews based on Word2Vec, TextBlob, VADER, and Gated Recurrent
 Units (GRU). Word2Vec is employed for word embeddings to extract semantic
 1
word relationships for improved feature representation. TextBlob and VADER
 are implemented as lexicon-based sentiment analysis tools, for which TextBlob
 is interested in polarity and subjectivity and VADER is engineered for short
 texts with clear-cut sentiment indications. Besides, deep learning architecture
 in the form of GRU is employed for extracting long dependencies and context
 associations between words of text corpora for enhanced sentiment classifica
tion. Methods are experimented and contrasted on the basis of a benchmark
 IMDB dataset with reference to accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Exper
imental findings substantiate that sentiment handling by deep learning-based
 approaches, i.e., GRU via Word2Vec embeddings, is better than traditional lexi
con based approaches. The work provides insights to NLP-based opinion mining
 researchers and practitioners regarding the merit of utilizing hybrid approaches
 towards sentiment classification.
